# Distributed and CUDA-Accelerated Deep Learning for Image Classification Project Overview
This project implements a complete CNN training system in C++ using OpenCV for image processing. The model classifies bone X-ray images as either normal or fractured.
Key Features

CNN implementation from scratch 
Custom backpropagation algorithm
OpenCV integration for image processing
Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
Real-time training progress monitoring
